- consider adding a `.gitignore`  file to your root and include the line `.DS_Store` in it to make sure it doesn't end up on github

- move your `main.css` file to the bottom of all of your linked css files. This allows your file access to all others above it.

- you only need to require one instance of your jquery in your HTML5

- can you merge your `main.js` and `app.js` together? If you prefer to keep your game and site logic separate, consider changing the game file to `fishgame.js` instead.

- Fantastic CSS work! Consider organizing your css selectors by tags, then classes, then ids. This makes a descending pattern of specificity.

- Remove unused and commented code from your javascript files.

- your entire website is 181mb; that's too big!  Try to optimize your images in Photoshop for websites.  That way your site will load and run MUCH faster.
